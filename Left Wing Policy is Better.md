# Left Wing Policy is Better

Left wing policy has consistently been shown to be better for the average worker, ensure better stability, and ensure their material conditions - those mainly being consistent low cost access to food and housing, free healthcare, free education, democracy, and strong communities to live in.

## Government In Economy:

- High government intervention is better
  
  - Reduces instabilities and market failures, reduces corporate misbehaviour, reduces impact on average worker in jobs and cost, monopoly dominance is restricted
  - Federal regulations in the United States saved a net \$131-$636 billion over 10 years

## Taxation:

- Progressive taxation is betters

- Higher taxes on wealth, corporations, and income
  
  - "But they just leave and take their money":
    
    - Evidence shows most people don't leave if you create a nice area to stay
    
    - Majority of people with high wealth concentrations are open to taxation 
  
  - "They earned that money":
    
    - People are starving, your selfish "right to money" does not matter
    
    - There are no fair earnings until every human has the basic right to life

- More funding for public investment

## Government Spending:

- High social spending (welfare, education, health)
  
  - Much better living standards for the average person, more people can become workers and contribute, access to welfare proprtionally increases the amount by which people contribute to the economy

- Public investment in infrastructure
  
  - Funding public infrastructure has on average a consistent high profit, increases industrial capabiilty, better access to services

## Labour and Employment:

- Strong labor unions

- Worker protections, minimum wage increases
  
  - "Companies can't afford it, jobs will go down" - relative rate minimum wage increases does not negatively impact job rates, companies profits continually increase, they still need workers, and they can afford it

## Ownership and Regulation:

- Public ownership of services
  
  - Services don't operate on a profit motive, they can take into account the return on investment from the usage of the services and effect on population
  
  - They can implement long-term infrastructure plans much more easily

- Regulation of industry
  
  - Businesses consistently compete, monopolize and dominate each other
  
  - This contributes to small businesses being crushed, boom-bust cycles increasing in rate, harming the economy, so they need to be regulated

## Social Equality:

- Social justice and minority rights
  
  - Systemic racism is consistently statistically proven on multiple levels
  
  - LGBTQ+ rights are real issues that have been proven
  
  - It's beneficial in the short term and long term, isn't a net-negative cost, improves capability of those previously opppressed

## Welfare:

- Universal benefits
  
  - "Why don't they just work?" - 
    
    - Jobs aren't easy to get in a right-wing market, no substantial evidence to suggest that the majority of claimants don't wish to seek work
    
    - Many physically or mentally cannot work, have substantial care responsibility, in exceptional circumstances such as homelessness and facing abuse
    
    - Some work but earn so low that they can still claim them
  
  - Access to welfare and benefits results in a net profit, increases productive capability and net economic benefit per worker
  
  - Social programs directly lead to very high mortality reduction, reduce homelessness rates, poverty rates, increased literacy

## Healthcare:

- Universal public healthcare
  
  - We can afford it, it's the most efficient as there's no profit motive, every human deserves the right to healthcare

## Education:

- Public schooling investment
  
  - More investment into schools improves educational outcomes, reduces initial and potential poverty rates, better student job and life outcomes

- Access programs and student aid
  
  - Students with worst conditions can have equal outcomes, consistently ensures higher capability among these students to perform well, disabled students deserve the same too

## Criminal Justice:

- Rehabiliation focus
  
  - Rehabiliation empirically shown to more effectively reduce crime rates and reoffending rates 

## Democratic Reforms:

- Easier voting

- Institutional transparency

- These are self-explanatory

## International Policy

- International co-operation
  
  - Improves outcomes for workers due to increased trade

- Limited millitary intervention
  
  - Reduced potential for conflicts, people don't have to die as a result of profit-seeking motives

- Fair trade and worker standards
  
  - Ensure people aren't being abused and enslaved 
  
  - Farmers actually reap a better proportion of the profits of their produce, and can afford to live

## Climate:

- Climate action and regulation
  
  - Climate change is proven, temperature is increasing, already killing wildlife. killing people, permanently changing effects on planet, must be reduced

- Renewable energy investment
  
  - With proper technology adoption and investment, shown to be higher profit in the long term, considerably reduces energy costs is the long term, doesn't contribute to climate change, reduces systemic climate risk

## Immigration:

- Higher immigration
  
  - Immigration has a positive link with increase in median wage, boosts economic output, improves productive capability, fills jobs that aren't usually
  
  - "They commit more crimes"
    
    - As a determining factor, no, as a group, yes, but a higher proportion doesn't mean a causal link, that has to be proven by testing against biases, which hasn't been done
    
    - There are several other factors commonly associated with immigrants causing a noticeable higher rate within the group itself, that being poverty, racial background, systemic factors typically
  
  - "Culture gets ruined" - Racist bullshit, not even gonna refute this

## Technology and Research:

- Regulate tech monopolies
  
  - Tech monopolies continually violate consumer laws and steal data, using user-preferences to emotionally manipulate choices
  
  - Act in ways that are harmful to the average person, in terms of climate, monopolized control of industry

- Fund more new technology and science within public industry
  
  - Effective plans have shown to increase productive output, industrial capacity, consumer benefit, and improve for the average worker
  
  - This is when the profits are actually directed towards something that benefits the people

## Housing:

- Public housing
  
  - Public funded subsidized housing is much more affordable, even free for those who can't afford it at all, leads to consistently higher access to housing
  
  - Mass housing projects beneficial in the long term for provisions

- Rent controls
  
  - Very effective in terms of reducing impact on people barely affording rent, mainly when combined with reduced zoning laws and mass housing plans

## Transport:

- Public transport
  
  - Cheaper, faster, cleaner, more efficient, all empirically proven, right to your own transport still ensured, reduces traffic on roads
  
  - Mass programs are very profit effective, even with no profit margin necessary
  
  - Proper implementation and long-term investment towards infrastructure and systems, means free transport can be ensured for the majority or even everyone, at little to no cost

## Religion:

- Secular state
  
  - Religious old traditions that used to encourage slavery shouldn't influence policy that directly affect people's lives

- Support freedom of belief
  
  - Basic moral right, just don't extend to harmful beliefs allowing to express and practice certain things

By profit in the public sector, I refer to net positive social return that is reinvested back into the sectors.
