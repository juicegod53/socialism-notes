# Common Questions

## What is socialism?

Socialism is defined as social ownership of the means of production. This can take multiple forms, the main ones being: state ownership, co-operative ownership, and community ownership.

## Why do we need socialism?

Capitalism has directly led to mass wealth consolidation, poverty, starvation, famines, genocide, warmongering, imperialism, and so on. The inherent contradictions of capitalism have consistently took root and destroyed any attempt at reform of the system.

Socialism is necessary, as workers controlling the means of production, means the capitalist no longer reaps the surplus value of the worker's labour. The interests of the 99%, the working people (i.e. the proletariat) are placed equally.

## Why can't we just have social democracy?

Social democracy is the view that we can reform capitalism, through things like progressive taxation, market and corporate regulations, some nationalised industry, and a welfare state to meet the needs of people.

Social democracies have consistently backslid to neoliberalism. This led to privatization, market liberalization, lower wages, weakened workers rights, higher living costs, more austerity, higher poverty rates, housing prices skyrocketing, and higher unemployment rates.

Social democracy still performs trade through exploitative markets, and engages in imperialism, via it's leverage of foreign capital for cheap commodity extraction, and production, through the exploitation of modern-day slaves in the Global South.

The welfare states are contributed to by this resource extraction, this is also the reason why most successful attempts at social democracy, came from countries that were already heavily developed, and central members of the imperial core, and it typically failed in other countries.

## Does socialism actually work?

Yes.

[Do Publicly Owned, Planned Economies Work?](https://archive.is/t9JeG) - addresses common misconceptions about the USSR's economy, including rate of growth, the real benefits, and the truth behind what led to it's failure.

[Did Socialism work in the USSR?](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/main/capitalism_doesnt_work.md)

The USSR had a more nutritious diet than the USA, higher calories consumed per person than the USA, the 2nd fastest growing economy of the 20th century (starting from semi-feudal), continuous growth for 70 years, free universal healthcare, most doctors per capita in the world, practically no unemployment.

They moved to 41.6 hour work weeks before most of the world, had triple the amount of paid leave than the USA on average, free education at all levels, a 99% literacy rate, eradicated extreme poverty, had socialized housing, and practically no homelessness, housing was shared initially but developments were made later.
