# Common Questions

## What is socialism?

Socialism is defined as social ownership of the means of production. This can take multiple forms, the main ones being: state ownership, co-operative ownership, and community ownership.

## Why do we need socialism?

Capitalism has directly led to mass wealth consolidation, poverty, starvation, famines, genocide, warmongering, imperialism, and so on. The inherent contradictions of capitalism have consistently took root and destroyed any attempt at reform of the system.

Socialism is necessary, as workers controlling the means of production, means the capitalist no longer reaps the surplus value of the worker's labour. The interests of the 99%, the working people (i.e. the proletariat) are placed equally.

## Why can't we just have social democracy?

Social democracy is the view that we can reform capitalism, through things like progressive taxation, market and corporate regulations, some nationalised industry, and a welfare state to meet the needs of people.

Social democracies have consistently backslid to neoliberalism. This led to privatization, market liberalization, lower wages, weakened workers rights, higher living costs, more austerity, higher poverty rates, housing prices skyrocketing, and higher unemployment rates.

Social democracy still performs trade through exploitative markets, and engages in imperialism, via it's leverage of foreign capital for cheap commodity extraction, and production, through the exploitation of modern-day slaves in the Global South.

The welfare states are contributed to by this resource extraction, this is also the reason why most successful attempts at social democracy, came from countries that were already heavily developed, and central members of the imperial core, and it typically failed in other countries.

[Socialism FAQ](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/main/socialism_faq.md)

USSR had:

- More nutritious diet than the USA

- Higher calories consumed per person than the USA

- 2nd fastest growing economy of the 20th century (starting from semi-feudal), continuous growth for 70 years

- Free universal healthcare

- Most doctors per capita in the world

- Practically no unemployment

- Moved to 40 hour work weeks before most of the world

- Triple the amount of paid leave than the USA on average

- Free education at all levels

- 99% literacy rate

- Eradicated extreme poverty

- Socialized housing, practically no homelessness, shared initially but developments made later

Now the USSR was by no means perfect, before many of these benefits, there were devastating famines that killed millions. The liberalization from the post-Khrushchev era did not help with these things either.
